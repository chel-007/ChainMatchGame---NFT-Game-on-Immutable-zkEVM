# ChainMatchGame---NFT-Game-on-Immutable-zkEVM



## Brief Breakdown of Chain Match Game - NFT Game on Immutable zkEVM


For this Bounty Project, I developed a Memory Match Game in which players engage by **matching various well-known blockchain icons** across multiple levels. 

The game begins with a limited amount of unique icons arranged in a small grid panel. As players successfully complete each level, the difficulty increases, ultimately culminating at Level 5, where they face the challenge of **solving the game within a few seconds**.

Upon completing each level, players have the opportunity to mint NFTs that reflect their growing proficiency in recognizing unique blockchain symbols.

## NFTs in ChainMatch Game

In Chain Match, the NFTs are deployed on Immutable's zkEVM using the [simple boilerplate code](https://github.com/immutable/zkevm-boilerplate) available from Immutable's presets repository. The contract is deployed with the Game Owner (that's me!) being granted the Minter Role, and players can conveniently **interact with its functions via their Passport** wallet interface.

The NFT smart contract is rather straightforward, consisting of just two primary functions: ***one for minting NFTs*** and the other for ***obtaining a list of existing NFTs***.
